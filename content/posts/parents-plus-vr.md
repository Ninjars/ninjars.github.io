What happens when you introduce your game-phobic parents to VR? This summer, I found out.
<!--more-->
Lets set out the profiles: both of my parents are over 60, and both are still active. 

My dad is generally pretty cautious around technology and skeptical of it, concerned around corporate spying and personal privacy. He's able to use computers for word processing and email, but tends to lose track of his phone and doesn't like to use many apps on it out of concern of surveillance. 

Mum on the other hand enjoys her gadgets. She may struggle with getting programs to do what she wants sometimes, but she's long been using online editorial software professionally and is able to oversee the creation of an online store for her burgeoning pottery business.

When it comes to video games, however, they've both historically been towards the "skeptical to hostile" end of the spectrum. From worrying about my homework-to-gaming ratio to fretting about the impact of "ultra-violent and realistic" shooters like GoldenEye 64 on my psyche, my love for the shiny pixels has always been a concern for them even as they accepted that it was a common part of a modern upbringing. 

Seeing my love of games turn into a career in tech has tempered their objections somewhat but there's still that legacy of their relationship to gaming to consider, and it's always been something of a gulf between us: a hobby they couldn't really share with me, outside of the novelty of Wii Sports or appreciating my excitement at completing Ocarina of Time for the first time.

## The Quest Begins
When Covid-19 and the associated lockdown struck the UK in early 2020 I ended up buying myself an Oculus Quest as a birthday present - and was immediately enthused. Beatsaber and Pistol Whip became my immediate faves, and indeed for a good while my main source of exercise! The first evening I played Pistol Whip so much that I had sore thighs for a week - both an indictment of my physical condition and an appreciation for how effectively a game can encourage one to push their limits! 

When I eventually had the good fortune to visit my parents in the late summer I took the headset along (an amazing feature of the Quest!), hoping that perhaps we could at least get a few laughs out of it. I also picked up a Chromecast for them, enabling the Quest to stream to the TV and so turning the VR headset into a communal experience.

## Beatsaber
The first game I introduced them to was Beatsaber. Not only is this one of the most defining games of the VR genre, it also perfectly captures all the best aspects of a VR game: you don't need to physically move so there's no risk of motion sickness, and the only gameplay input is the tracking of your hands - no buttons to worry about!

I played a song as an introduction (showing off my 'expert' skills a little on a favourite song - a boy's gotta have fun ;) ) before handing the headset over. Neither parents immediately intuited the 1:1 tracking of the in-game controllers with their actual hands, but after maybe 30-60 seconds they got it and in short order were clearly immersed. With every other gaming experience you have to be very aware of the abstraction between controller and action, but at its best this melts away in Beatsaber.
