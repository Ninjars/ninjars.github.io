Experimenting with a Voxel engine Unity asset to see if it would satisfy an idea I had for a deformable-terrain turret game.

Unfortunately there wasn't a good solution for managing per-voxel values, eg current damage, and processing the removal of multiple voxels at once, eg by an explosion, was extremely slow to process. In the end I abandoned the level of simulation that this could have given in favour of something more achievable and managed.
