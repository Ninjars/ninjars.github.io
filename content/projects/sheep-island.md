Sheep Island was a little project I made as a Christmas gift for a close friend. It's the first self-generated project since I became a developer where I've actually managed to get to a point where I could call it "finished"!

It borrowed the sheep that were developed for the earlier project involving a procedurally generated island with roaming flocks upon it.
