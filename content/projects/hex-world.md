Repurposing hexagon grid board core logic from Hextopia with an aim to building the foundations of a new game.

With vague ideas about a game with stages based on procedurally generated platforms bouncing around in my head, and with an off-the-shelf voxel engine not looking like quite the right sort of thing for what I had in mind, I set out to see if I could build deformable hexagon-tile based platforms instead. I succeeded at this, but in the process realised that for gameplay purposes I was actually more interested in building a solid data structure underlying the terrain to power systems and to help shape worlds that were interesting to play as much as they were to look at.
