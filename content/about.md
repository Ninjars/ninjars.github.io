## Who?
I'm an Android developer with an enthusiastic but sporadic interest in other technologies. Sometimes that means that I'm making bits of games in Unity 3D, poking around machine learning basics, or dabbling in web development stacks.

## Why?
I've had a clumsy, plain html page for a while, and have always been a bit sad about it. An incidental Twitter comment about using Hugo for journaling got me excited, and with a long weekend giving me a bit of time I thought I'd have a go at renovating my website into something a little more shiny.

## What?
I've been meaning to start writing a little more, but the expectation of coming up with a full blog is more than I can commit to. I hope to be able to use this as a place to sketch out and document little projects and ideas with a bit more persistence and accessibility than my twitter history.
