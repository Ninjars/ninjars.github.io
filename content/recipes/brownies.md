Simply the best brownie. Gooey but light, with wonderful nutty flavours throughout and a crumbly flake on top.

### Ingredients
- 25g/1oz macadamia nuts
- 25g/1oz Brazil nuts
- 25g/1oz pecan nuts
- 25g/1oz hazelnuts
- 50g/2oz dark chocolate (75 per cent cocoa solids)
- 110g/4oz butter
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 225g/8oz granulated sugar
- 50g/2oz plain flour
- 1 level tsp baking powder
- Â¼ level teaspoon salt

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan/Gas 4.

2. Begin by chopping the nuts roughly, not too small, then place them on a baking sheet and toast them in a preheated oven for 8 minutes exactly. Please use a timer here otherwise you'll be throwing burned nuts away all day!

3. While the nuts are cooking, put the chocolate and butter together in a large mixing bowl fitted over a saucepan of barely simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn't touch the water.

4. Allow the chocolate to melt, then beat it until smooth, remove it from the heat.

5. Simply stir in all the other ingredients into the chocolate until thoroughly blended.

6. Now spread the mixture evenly into the prepared tin and bake on the centre shelf of the oven for 30 minutes or until it's slightly springy in the centre.

7. Remove the tin from the oven and leave it to cool for 10 minutes before cutting into roughly 15 squares. Then, using a palette knife, transfer the squares on to a wire rack to finish cooling.

### Blurb
Originally sourced from one of my mum's cookbooks, this Delia recipe used to be available on the BBC Good Food's website but has over the years vanished and now the only source I could find was [this... archive? Backup? Copy?](https://git.macropus.org/bbc-food/www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/fournutchocolatebrow_67259.html).

So, in order to keep access to what is quite possibly the best brownie recipe in the world I've now reproduced it here where I'll at least be able to find it again!
