        Hi! I'm an Android developer, currently employed at 
        <a href="https://www.touchsurgery.com/">Touch Surgery</a>. 
        I've previously worked at Six to Start since 2013 making 
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sixtostart.zombiesrunclient"><i>Zombies, Run!</i></a>, 
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sixtostart.thewalk"><i>The Walk</i></a> 
        and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sixtostart.superheroworkout"><i>7 Minute Superhero</i></a>. 
        I started out teaching myself Python in my lunch breaks working as an Assistant Architect back in 2012, and I now ship probably the most unique running app on Google Play Store to hundreds of thousands of players. It's been quite a ride!

        You can probably tell from this site that my forte isn't web development 
        (to be fair, this is the product of just spending an evening working out how to use github pages 
        and redirects, refactoring old web experiments and knocking something together), 
        but I felt it important to have something other than a holding page for my email domain. 
        I'm hoping that taking this first step towards a web presence will encourage me to put a 
        little more time into it and make something worth talking about!

        I enjoy coming up with ideas for games as much as I enjoy playing them; most of my energies go 
        into my day job, but as you can see from my github I occasionally get further than just thinking 
        about things! I found <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/kings-cup">participating</a> 
        in <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam 2016</a> to be a wonderful opportunity to 
        indulge in my game developer urgings, and would strongly encourage everyone with an interest to 
        do a game jam if they have the opportunity; I certainly can't wait for my next chance!

        I have in the past experimented with web dev and javascript; you can see the results of these 
        experiments in <a href="./pages/tribal_life.html">Tribal Life</a> and the follow-up 
        <a href="./pages/living_music.html">Living Music</a>.
